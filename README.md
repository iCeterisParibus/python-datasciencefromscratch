# python-datasciencefromscratch
Collection of the python scripts written as notes from the O'Reilly "Data Science from Scratch" by Joel Grus.

All scripts are written by Bryce Cashell with all information being provided by Joel Grus in "Data Science from Sccratch."

All of these scripts are an opportunity for me to practice python and build a collection of scripts which could be used to review and, possibly, repurpose code I have already written for future projects. These scripts are not a replacement for the purchase and reading of "Data Science from Scratch" but are an additional study aid for myself in my aspirations to become a productive data scientist.
