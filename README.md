# python-datasciencefromscratch
Collection of the Python scripts to be used as a directory of concepts and opportunity to practice coding in Python. These scripts and supplemental files are to serve, mostly, as notes from the study of O'Reilly Publishing's "Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python" by Joel Grus.

Acknowledgement is given to Joel Grus and O'Reilly Publishing for the majority of copy and code examples. In some cases, additional exporation was taken by Bryce Cashell to better understand a concept. Outside of these instances, all information and examples should be considered provided by Joel Grus and O'Reilly. These scripts are in no way a replacement for the purchase and reading of "Data Science from Scratch First Principles with Python".

These scripts have provided myself, Bryce Cashell, an opportunity to practice coding in Python and build a collection of scripts which may be used to review and potentially repurpose for future projects. I would like to thank Joel Grus and O'Reilly for providing such a useful guide to break into the field of Data Science.
